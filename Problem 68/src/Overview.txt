--Then update for 5gon check
--Optimizations:
    (a) Make such that first you find is also maximal
    (b) If that's impossible, what about
    cutting off loop earlier when least available is less than leading digit?

Basic idea:
--16 digit means 10 must be outside
--choosing inner stations => largest pair must be completed by smallest number remaining
    b/c otherwise wherever we would use that number would fall short of the sum
--once you've picked one outer one, the rest are determined by having to sum --
    hopefully you have the digits to do it
--thus, we only have to check as many inner arrangements there are --
    (9 choose 5) which can be arranged in 4! ways => ~3000 things to try, which is much more manageable than 10!

--Possible improvement: search such that first you find is also greatest
